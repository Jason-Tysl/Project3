This is the readme for CSE 3341 Project 3, the Core Language executor.

Files: 

Special Features: N/A

Overall design: For most of the execute functions in each of the classes,
it is almost fully copied from the print function. Realistically it's the
same, except we don't have to worry about indents nor printing discarded 
tokens. The pattern is followed almost fully until we get to the end with
the ID's which is where a majority of the new work is done (but idk how 
to do that yet hehe).

Testing & Bugs:
